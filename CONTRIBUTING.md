## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain strict type checking

describe('PipelineStage', () => {
	it('should handle successful execution', async () => {
		// Test implementation
	});

	it('should handle errors appropriately', async () => {
		// Test implementation
	});
});
